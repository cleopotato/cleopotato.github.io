# Personal Website Project

I wanted to craft a digital space that represents your unique identity, achievements, and aspirations
I enjoy learning new skills so this gives me an opportunity to hone them and expand my knowledge.

This is an updated version from the one I made during my last semester in college. It was inspired
by **neumorphism**. The lowered contrast between the foreground and the background gives it a
soft and simplistic realism for its overall effect.

**To-Do:**
- Play around with different colors. (I love purple but I'm being to biased!)
- Make it more interative? Add javascript?
- Add a toggle for light/dark mode.
